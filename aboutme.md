My name is <a href="https://github.com/patevs"><strong> Patrick Evans </strong></a> and I am a 19 year old 
student living in Wellington, New Zealand. I currently study at <i>Victoria University Wellington</i> 
where I am in my second year of study towards a Bachelor of Engineering in Software and Computer Science.

I am extremely interested in everything to do with engineering especially subjects of electronics, computer system, and software design and development. 

The pupose of this website is to create an enviroment for developing skilling and testing ideas on whatever 
topics I find intriguing or am studying.
