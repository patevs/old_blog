My name is <a href="https://github.com/patevs"><strong> Patrick Evans </strong></a> and I am a 21 year old student living in Wellington, New Zealand. I currently study at <i>Victoria University Wellington</i> where I am in my third year of study towards a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in Software.

I am interested in everything to do with engineering especially subjects of electronics, computer system, and software design and development. I am familiar with topics of the design and development of software and will be using this website with the purpose of exploring and furthering my knowledge and understanding in the testing, design, and development of; the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), [World-Wide-Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) content, along with any other topics I am studying or find interesting.
