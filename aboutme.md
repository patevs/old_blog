My name is <a href="https://github.com/patevs"><strong> Patrick Evans </strong></a> and I am a 21 year old student living in Wellington, New Zealand. I currently study at <i>Victoria University Wellington</i> where I am in my third year of study towards a Bachelor of Engineering in Software and Computer Science.

I am extremely interested in everything to do with engineering especially subjects of electronics, computer system, and software design and development. 

The purpose of this website is to create an enviroment for developing skills and testing ideas on whatever topics I find intriguing or am studying.
