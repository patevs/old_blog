__Jenkins__ is an extensible, open source continuous integration server. It builds and tests your software continuously and monitors the execution and status of remote jobs, making it easier for team members and users to regularly obtain the latest stable code.

Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association of Hudson. Hudson is a very popular open-source Java-based continuous integration tool developed by Sun Microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle. After the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, a fork was created from the Hudson source code, which brought about the introduction of Jenkins.

# Jenkins CI

Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place. The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how Jenkins works.

## What is Continuous Integration?

__Continuous Integration__ (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.


## Distrubted Builds

Sometimes many build machines are required if there are instances wherein there are a larger and heavier projects which get built on a regular basis. And running all of these builds on a central machine may not be the best option. In such a scenario, one can configure other Jenkins machines to be slave machines to take the load off the master Jenkins server.

Sometimes you might also need several different environments to test your builds. In this case using a slave to represent each of your required environments is almost a must.

A slave is a computer that is set up to offload build projects from the master and once setup this distribution of tasks is fairly automatic. The exact delegation behavior depends on the configuration of each project; some projects may choose to "stick" to a particular machine for a build, while others may choose to roam freely between slaves.

Since each slave runs a separate program called a "slave agent" there is no need to install the full Jenkins (package or compiled binaries) on a slave. There are various ways to start slave agents, but in the end the slave agent and Jenkins master needs to establish a bi-directional communication link (for example a TCP/IP socket.) in order to operate.
