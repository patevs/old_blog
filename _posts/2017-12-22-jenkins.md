<strong>Jenkins</strong> is an extensible, open source continuous integration server. It builds and tests your software continuously and monitors the execution and status of remote jobs, making it easier for team members and users to regularly obtain the latest stable code.<br>
<br>
Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association of Hudson. Hudson is a very popular open-source Java-based continuous integration tool developed by Sun Microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle. After the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, a fork was created from the Hudson source code, which brought about the introduction of Jenkins.

# Jenkins CI

Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place.<br>
The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple jenkins workflow:

## What is Continuous Integration?

__Continuous Integration__ (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.

## Distrubted Builds

Sometimes many build machines are required if there are instances wherein there are a larger and heavier projects which get built on a regular basis. And running all of these builds on a central machine may not be the best option. In such a scenario, one can configure other Jenkins machines to be slave machines to take the load off the master Jenkins server.

Sometimes you might also need several different environments to test your builds. In this case using a slave to represent each of your required environments is almost a must.

A slave is a computer that is set up to offload build projects from the master and once setup this distribution of tasks is fairly automatic. The exact delegation behavior depends on the configuration of each project; some projects may choose to "stick" to a particular machine for a build, while others may choose to roam freely between slaves.

Since each slave runs a separate program called a "slave agent" there is no need to install the full Jenkins (package or compiled binaries) on a slave. There are various ways to start slave agents, but in the end the slave agent and Jenkins master needs to establish a bi-directional communication link (for example a TCP/IP socket.) in order to operate.

## Key Terms 

#### Agent
An agent is typically a machine, or container, which connects to a Jenkins master and executes tasks when directed by the master.
#### Artifact
An immutable file generated during a Build or Pipeline run which is archived onto the Jenkins Master for later retrieval by users.
#### Build
Result of a single execution of a Project
#### Cloud
A System Configuration which provides dynamic Agent provisioning and allocation, such as that provided by the Azure VM Agents or Amazon EC2 plugins.
#### Core
The primary Jenkins application (jenkins.war) which provides the basic web UI, configuration, and foundation upon which Plugins can be built.
#### Downstream
A configured Pipeline or Project which is triggered as part of the execution of a separate Pipeline or Project.
#### Executor
A slot for execution of work defined by a Pipeline or Project on a Node. A Node may have zero or more Executors configured which corresponds to how many concurrent Projects or Pipelines are able to execute on that Node.
#### Fingerprint
A hash considered globally unique to track the usage of an Artifact or other entity across multiple Pipelines or Projects.
#### Folder
An organizational container for Pipelines and/or Projects, similar to folders on a file system.
#### Item
An entity in the web UI corresponding to either a: Folder, Pipeline, or Project.
#### Job
A deprecated term, synonymous with Project.
#### Label
User-defined text for grouping Agents, typically by similar functionality or capability. For example linux for Linux-based agents or docker for Docker-capable agents.
#### Master
The central, coordinating process which stores configuration, loads plugins, and renders the various user interfaces for Jenkins.
#### Node
A machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and capable of executing Pipelines or Projects. Both the Master and Agents are considered to be Nodes.
#### Project
A user-configured description of work which Jenkins should perform, such as building a piece of software, etc.
#### Pipeline
A user-defined model of a continuous delivery pipeline, for more read the Pipeline chapter in this handbook.
#### Plugin
An extension to Jenkins functionality provided separately from Jenkins Core.
#### Publisher
Part of a Build after the completion of all configured Steps which publishes reports, sends notifications, etc.
#### Stage
stage is part of Pipeline, and used for defining a conceptually distinct subset of the entire Pipeline, for example: "Build", "Test", and "Deploy", which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress.
#### Step
A single task; fundamentally steps tell Jenkins what to do inside of a Pipeline or Project.
#### Trigger
A criteria for triggering a new Pipeline run or Build.
#### Update Center
Hosted inventory of plugins and plugin metadata to enable plugin installation from within Jenkins.
#### Upstream
A configured Pipeline or Project which triggers a separate Pipeline or Project as part of its execution.
#### Workspace
A disposable directory on the file system of a Node where work can be done by a Pipeline or Project. Workspaces are typically left in place after a Build or Pipeline run completes unless specific Workspace cleanup policies have been put in place on the Jenkins Master.
