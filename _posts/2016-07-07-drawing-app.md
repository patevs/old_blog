Created with Javascript implementing the use of the HTML5 canvas element as the output display.

The app uses Javascript for controlling the logic of the paintbrush's position on the screen and if the mouse is pressed. Javascript is also utalised in the brush colour selection and radius control. The HTML5 canvas element is implemented for displaying the drawings created with the app.

Take a look at the git repository<a href="https://github.com/patevs/drawing-app">here</a> if you are interested in seeing the code for the app.
