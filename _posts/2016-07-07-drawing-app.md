subtitle: Testing javascript and HTML5 canvas

In order to expand my knowledge and skills in the javascript language,
I have created a simple in browser drawing app.

The app uses javascript for the basic logic and an HTML5 canvas element
as the method of displaying the drawings.

The app can be found <a href="https://patevs.github.io/drawing-app/">here</a>.
