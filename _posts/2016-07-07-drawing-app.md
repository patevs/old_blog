The app is very basic, using javascript for the logic and an HTML5 canvas element for displaying the drawings/images.

Take a look at my <a href="https://patevs.github.io/drawing-app/">github account</a> page if you are interested in seeing the code for the app.

Otherwise, the app can be found <a href="https://patevs.github.io/drawing-app/">here</a>.
