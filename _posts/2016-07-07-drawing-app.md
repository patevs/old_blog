Created using javascript and the HTML5 canvas element, I have made this drawing 
app in order to further my knowledge on the design and development of web applications.

The app is very basic, using javascript for the logic and the HTML5 canvas element for displaying the drawings/images.

Take a look at my <a href="https://patevs.github.io/drawing-app/">github account</a> page if you are interested in seeing the code for the app.

Otherwise, the app can be found <a href="https://patevs.github.io/drawing-app/">here</a>.
