The Command Line Interface (CLI) is an essential and powerful tool for any developer. The Command
Line gives a user (client) a means of interacting with a computer program through the issuing of 
commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (commands).

## Basic Commands
`ls -a` or `dir /A` : lists contents of working direcotry, including hidden files and directories

`pwd` : Outputs the name of the current directory

`mkdir` : Creates a new directory in the working directory

`touch` : Creates a new file inside the working directory

`cp` : copies files

`mv` : moves and renames files

`rm` : removes files

`rm -r` : removes directories

## Useful Commands
`sort` : sorts lines of text alphabetically

`uniq` : filters duplicate, adjacent lines of test

`grep` : searches for a text pattern and outputs it

`sed` : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it

## Redirection Commands
`>` : redirects stdout of a command to a file

`>>` : redirects stdout of a command to a file, appending the new content

`<` : redirects stdin to a command

`|` : redirects stdout of a command to another command
