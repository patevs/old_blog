You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

## Here is a list of some Bash/Shell commands

# Basic Commands
`ls -a` or `dir /A` : lists contents of working direcotry, including hidden files and directories

`pwd` : Outputs the name of the current directory

`mkdir` : Creates a new directory in the working directory

`touch` : Creates a new file inside the working directory

`cp` : copies files

`mv` : moves and renames files

`rm` : removes files

`rm -r` : removes directories

# Useful Commands
`sort` : sorts lines of text alphabetically

`uniq` : filters duplicate, adjacent lines of test

`grep` : searches for a text pattern and outputs it

`sed` : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it

<br>

# Redirection Commands
`>` : redirects stdout of a command to a file

`>>` : redirects stdout of a command to a file, appending the new content

`<` : redirects stdin to a command

`|` : redirects stdout of a command to another command
