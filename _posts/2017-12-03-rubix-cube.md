## Stage Three : Solve Cube

| Cross | Cross Sides | Corners | __Solved__ |

<br>
__Cross:__
1. Sart solving the last layer making a yellow cross on the top of the cube. At this point we don't have to pay attention to the colours of the sides.

2. After making the yellow cross on the top of the cube you have to put the yellow edge pieces on their final places to match the colours of the side center pieces. Switch the front and left yellow edges with the following algorithm:

__Cross Sides:__
1. 
2. 

__Corners:__
1. Only the last layer corners are left unsolved. First we have to get them to the right spot, so don't worry about the orientation in this step.
2. Find a piece which is already on the right place, move it to the right-front-top corner then apply the following algorithm to switch (cycle) the three wrong pieces marked on the image.

__Solved:__<br>
All pieces are on their right places you just have to orient the yellow corner pieces to finish the puzzle. This proved to be the most complicated step so read the instructions carefully.
