The <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>S</strong>ecurity <strong>P</strong>roject (OWASP) is a worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software.

<br>
It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox.
