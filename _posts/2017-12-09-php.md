<strong>PHP</strong> (<strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>P</strong>re<strong>p</strong>rocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">web development</a> but also used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose</a> programming language.
The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has gone on to create a formal PHP <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2697195/enterprise-software/php-gets-a-formal-specification--at-last.html">specification</a>.<br>

<strong>XAMPP</strong> is a free and open source cross-platform (<strong>X</strong>) web server package that consists of the <strong>A</strong>pache HTTP Server, <strong>M</strong>ariaDB database, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreters</a> for scripts written in the <strong>P</strong>HP and <strong>P</strong>erl programming languages.<br>

# PHP 

## Basic Setup
The basic method of PHP development is to build PHP code on top of web server software like [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) or Internet Information Server ([ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services)). There is a "stack" of software that is generally used for a fully functional development environment: either LAMP or WAMP, which can stand for either <strong>L</strong>inux or <strong>W</strong>indows/<strong>A</strong>pache/<strong>M</strong>ySQL/<strong>P</strong>HP.<br>
<br>

## XAMPP 
It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file which is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.<br>
