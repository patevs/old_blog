<strong>PHP</strong> (<strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>P</strong>re<strong>p</strong>rocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">web development</a> but also used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose</a> programming language.
The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has gone on to create a <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2697195/enterprise-software/php-gets-a-formal-specification--at-last.html">formal PHP specification</a>.

<strong>XAMPP</strong> is a free and open source cross-platform (<strong>X</strong>) program that consists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server"><strong>A</strong>pache HTTP Server</a>, <strong>M</strong>ariaDB database, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreters</a> for scripts written in the <strong>P</strong>HP and <strong>P</strong>erl programming languages.<br> 
It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes.<br>
Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file. XAMPP is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.
